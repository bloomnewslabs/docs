## Configuration

The Curation API is organized with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" title="REST" target="_blank">REST</a>.

All API methods use the URL Endpoint: [https://api.bloom.li/post/](https://api.bloom.li/post/) that must be accessed via HTTPS. Methods are only accessible using GET requests. The default quota is 1 call per 5 seconds, per publisher.

<br><br>

After the call, a [Response](#method-response) will be returned with information about the request's result.

<br>
